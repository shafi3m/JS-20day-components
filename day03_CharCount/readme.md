# 🚀 Day 3 – Character Count in Textarea

Part of my **20-Day JavaScript Component Challenge**!

---

## 📝 What It Does

A real-time character counter that updates as you type in a `<textarea>`.

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

- `input` event handling
- DOM selection with `getElementById`
- Live updates via `textContent`
- Optional: Limit characters with `maxlength`

---

## ✅ Why Use `maxlength`

- Prevents overtyping automatically
- No extra JS needed
- Improves user experience, especially in forms
