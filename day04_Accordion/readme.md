# 📂 Day 4 – Accordion Component

Part of my **20-Day JavaScript Component Challenge**!

---

## ✅ What Is It?

An **accordion** is a UI pattern where clicking a section header reveals or hides its content — like a dropdown FAQ.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Click a `<h3>` header to toggle the content below it.
- Uses JavaScript to:
  - Listen for clicks
  - Toggle visibility with `.nextElementSibling`

> 💡 Multiple sections can stay open at once.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Event handling on multiple elements
- DOM traversal with `nextElementSibling`
- Toggling classes for show/hide behavior
