# 🚀 Day 8 – Tabs Component

Welcome to **Day 8** of my **20-Day JavaScript Component Challenge**!  
In this project, we're building a **Tabs UI Component** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — perfect for organizing content in a clean, user-friendly way.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🟦 **Clickable tabs** to switch between content sections
- 🟨 Only one content panel visible at a time
- ✅ **Active tab highlighting** for better UX

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- Switching active states using `classList`
- Traversing DOM elements with `querySelectorAll` and `forEach`
- Toggling content dynamically without reloading the page
- Enhancing navigation flow using tabbed UI

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

- `addEventListener()`
- `forEach()` and conditionally applying classes
- `classList.add()`, `classList.remove()`
- DOM manipulation with `data-*` attributes
