# ⭐ Day 10 – Star Rating Component

Welcome to **Day 10** of my **20-Day JavaScript Component Challenge**!  
Today’s project is a fully interactive **Star Rating System** built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — just like you'd see in e-commerce reviews or feedback forms.

---

## 🎯 Features

- ⭐ Click to select a rating (1 to 5 stars)
- 🔄 Dynamic visual feedback — stars light up as you click
- 📝 Rating value is displayed as text

---

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- Handling click events with `addEventListener`
- Reading custom attributes (`data-value`) using `getAttribute`
- Looping through NodeLists with `forEach`
- Using `classList.toggle()` with a condition to simplify adding/removing classes
- Real-world UI behavior using JavaScript and CSS only — no external libraries!

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

- `querySelectorAll()` and `forEach()`
- Reading attributes: `getAttribute("data-value")`
- Conditional toggling: `classList.toggle("selected", condition)`
- Styling selected elements with CSS
- Managing state visually using DOM and class logic
