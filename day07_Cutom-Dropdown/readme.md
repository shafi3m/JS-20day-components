# Custom Dropdown Menu (Day 7)

🎯 **Goal:** Build a custom dropdown using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with full control over style and behavior.

---

## 📌 What is a Custom Dropdown?

A custom dropdown is a manually created menu that mimics the functionality of a `<select>` element but is built using basic HTML tags like `div`, `ul`, and `li`, with styling and interaction added using CSS and JavaScript.

---

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- Creating interactive dropdowns without `<select>`
- Using `click` events to toggle visibility
- Adding/removing classes dynamically
- Updating the selected option in real-time
- Using `data-*` attributes for cleaner code

---

## 🛠️ How it Works

- A `div` displays the selected option.
- Clicking this `div` shows or hides the list of options (`ul`).
- Clicking an option (`li`) updates the selected value and closes the menu.

---

## 💡 Why Use It?

✅ Full control over styling  
✅ Smooth animations and interactions  
✅ Consistent appearance across all browsers  
🔸 Great for custom UI/UX requirements

> Note: Custom dropdowns require extra work to make them accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers).
