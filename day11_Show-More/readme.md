# 📖 Day 11 – Show More Component

Welcome to **Day 11** of my **20-Day JavaScript Component Challenge**!  
Today’s project is a **Show More / Show Less** content toggler – a super useful component for handling long blocks of text in a user-friendly way.

---

## 🎯 Features

- ⬇️ Expand text with a “Show More” button
- ⬆️ Collapse text with a “Show Less” button
- 🧠 Clean and minimal implementation with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- Working with `textContent` to update button labels
- Using `classList.toggle()` to expand/collapse sections
- Writing conditional logic to track state

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

- `addEventListener()` for button click handling
- `classList.contains()` and `classList.toggle()` for dynamic visibility
- Basic CSS transitions to enhance UI/UX
- Writing accessible toggle buttons

## 📌 Bonus

> If you're displaying long paragraphs (like FAQs, product descriptions, or bios), this pattern improves user experience by giving them control over what they see.

Stay tuned for **Day 12**!  
Let’s continue building one component at a time 💻✨
