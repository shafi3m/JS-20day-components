# 🚀 Day 9 – Notification Toast Component

Welcome to **Day 9** of my **20-Day JavaScript Component Challenge**!  
Today’s project is a sleek and simple **Notification Toast** component built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🔔 **Show** a toast notification on button click
- ⏳ Toast automatically **disappears** after 3 seconds
- 🎨 Smooth **fade and slide** animation for appearance and dismissal

---

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- Using CSS transitions with `opacity` and `bottom` properties for smooth animations
- Controlling element visibility using `visibility` instead of `display` to enable transitions
- Adding and removing CSS classes dynamically with JavaScript (`classList.add` / `remove`)
- Positioning a fixed element centered horizontally at the bottom of the viewport

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

- CSS transitions and animations
- `visibility` vs `display` for UI effects
- JavaScript event handling with `addEventListener`
- Timers using `setTimeout` for auto-dismiss behavior
