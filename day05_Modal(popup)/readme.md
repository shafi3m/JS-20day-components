# Day 5: Modal (Popup)

## 📌 What it is:

A **modal** is a popup dialog box that appears above the main page content and locks the background until it's closed.

## ⚙️ How it works:

- A button (e.g., "Subscribe") triggers the modal to appear by removing a `hidden` class.
- The modal overlays the current content, drawing user attention.
- Clicking the close icon (`×`) or the background outside the modal hides it again by re-adding the `hidden` class.

## 🧠 What you’ll learn:

- How to create a modal overlay using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- DOM manipulation to show/hide elements
- Managing `z-index`, `position`, and layering
- Enhancing user experience by focusing interactions

## 🚀 Features:
